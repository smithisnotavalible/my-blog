          of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the
          Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. The
          country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet,
          the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land
          reclamation projects. It has the third highest population density in the world. With a multicultural
          population and recognising the need to respect cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the
          nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua

          The third studio album and 47th project from the duo, Sing Me a Lullaby, My Sweet Temptation, its tracklist
          and its covers were all announced on June 2, 2022, via an Instagram post made by both of the Boy$. It is
          also notable that album is getting released at the same date that “I No Longer Fear the Razor Guarding My
          Heel'' got released back in 2015, which is one of the topics hinted at by the Boy$ in “$uicideboy$ Were
          Better in 2015.”

          The tracklist and imagery used for this project suit the Boy$‘ recurring theme of religion, with many of the
          song titles directly hinting at the Holy Bible: “Genesis” is the first track and also the first book of the
          Holy Bible, sorrow is described as a feeling the books widely explore, Babylon was an ancient kingdom
          pointed at by the Bible for its sinful manners, luxury is one of the seven deadly sins, and finally the evil
          that men do is represented by the original sin with disturbing the garden of Eden’s balance. It is also
          worth noting that the Genesis’ nature, which is to tale the Creation of the world, can be viewed as a
          lullaby itself.

          The first single for the project is late April’s “THE_EVIL_THAT_MEN_DO.” Is it followed by “Escape from
          BABYLON” on June 10, 2022.

          Donda 2 (often stylized as DONDA2) is the official sequel to Kanye West’s tenth studio album, Donda,
          released back in August 2021. The album will also be Kanye’s first independent release, as it was announced
          by Kanye himself that he had departed from Def Jam.

          Rumors of the album’s existence began on January 3, 2022, when it was reported that Steven Victor announced
          that Ye was working on the album.

          On January 27, 2022, Kanye officially announced that the album would release on February 22 and that Future
          would serve as the executive producer.

          Later that day, Ye shared an excerpt of a Bustle article explaining the significance of the date:

          According to the stars, the United States is finally getting a spiritual makeover with its first-ever Pluto
          Return on Feb. 22, 2022. Astrologically, a Pluto return is when the heavenly body returns to the same
          position in a birth chart where it was when the chart began.

          It was later revealed on February 7, 2022, that Ye had held a private album listening party in Los Angeles
          in Nobu with prevalent artists such as Drake, Travis Scott, and Yung Lean.
